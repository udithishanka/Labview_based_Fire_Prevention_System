# Labview_based_Fire_Prevention_System

During our fourth semester, we successfully designed a LabVIEW-based fire prevention system, which was later showcased at EXMO'23, the flagship technological exhibition of the University of Moratuwa, representing the Department of Electrical Engineering.

Our team, consisting of Darshana Sampath, myself (Udith), and Sankavi, applied our knowledge of sensor design and calibration, circuit design, LABVIEW programming, enclosure design, and software integration to create a system with remarkable accuracy and a swift reaction time for fire detection and suppression. The system utilized three types of sensors for fire detection: an IR sensor, a Max6675 thermocouple sensor, and an MQ2 gas sensor. The system's actuators included a water motor, an exhaust fan, and a buzzer. Additionally, we integrated peripheral devices such as a GSM SIM900A module and an LCD display for enhanced functionality.
